# User guide

## Getting started

Getting started with `sonar`'s CLI is really easy. First you need
to install it:

```bash
npm install -g @sonarwhal/sonar
```

You can also install it as a `devDependency` if you prefer not to
have it globally.

The next thing that `sonar` needs is a `.sonarrc` file. The fastest
and easiest way to create one is by using the flag `--init`:

```bash
sonar --init
```

This command will start a wizard that will ask you a series of questions
(e.g.: what collector to use, what formatter, which rules, etc.). Answer
them and you will end up with something similar to the following:

```json
{
    "collector": {
        "name": "collectorName"
    },
    "formatter": "formatterName",
    "rules": {
        "rule1": "error",
        "rule2": "error",
        "rule3": "error"
    }
}
```

## Rules

A `rule` is a test that your website needs to pass. `sonar` comes with
a few [built in ones](./rules/), but you can easily create your own or
download them from `npm`.

### Rule configuration

Rule severity can be one of the following:

* `off`: The rule will not be executed. This is the same as not having
  the rule under the `rules` section of a `.sonarrc` file.
* `warning`: The rule will be executed but it will not change the exit
  status code if an issue is found.
* `error`: The rule will be executed and will change the exit status
  code to `1` if an issue is found.

Additionally, some rules allow further customization. The configuration
in that case it will be similar to the following:

```json
"rules": {
    "rule1": ["severity", {
        "customization1": "value1",
        "customization2": "value2"
    }]
}
```

You can check which rules accept this kind of configuration by
visiting the [rules documentation](./rules/).

Sometimes you want to enable a rule but not for all the domains
a website depends on. For example, if your website loads some external
library from a CDN you might not have control over the HTTP headers
sent. To disable some rules for just some specific domains you need to
add a `ignoredUrls` to your `.sonarrc` file:

```json
"ignoredUrls": {
    ".*\\.domain1\\.com/.*": ["*"], // Apply to all the rules, events won't be emitted for that URLs.
    "www.domain2.net": ["disallowed-headers"] // Just apply to the rule `disallowed-headers`.
}
```

Properties can be:

* regular expressions, like `.*\\.domain1\\.com/.*`. This will match:
  * `something.domain1.com/index.html`
  * `somethingelse.domain1.com/image.png`
* some text, like `www.domain2.net`. In this case, if the resource URL
  contains the text, it will be a match. E.g.:
  * `www.domain2.net/index.php`
  * `www.domain2.net/image.png`

The value of the property has to be an array of strings where the
strings can be:

* `*` if you want to ignore all rules for the given domain.
* The ID of the rule to be ignored.

In the previous example we will:

* Ignore all rules for any resource that matches the regex `.*\\.domain1\\.com/.*`.
* Ignore the rule `disallowed-headers` for the domain `www.domain2.net`.

## Collectors

A `collector` is the interface between the `rule`s and the website
you are testing. `sonar` currently supports the following `collector`s:

To configure a collector you need to update your `.sonarrc` file to
make it look like the following:

```json
"collector": {
    "name": "collectorName"
}
```

Where `collectorName` is the name of the collector.

`collector`s can be configured as well. Maybe you want to do request
with another `userAgent`, change some of the other defaults, etc. To
do that, you just have to add a property `options` to your `collector`
property with the values you want to modify:

```json
"collector": {
    "name": "collectorName",
    "options": {}
}
```

The [`collector`s documentation](./collectors/) has more information
of what can be configured in each one.

## Formatters

A `formatter` takes the results of executing all the rules and
transforms them to be consumed by the user. A `formatter` can output
the results via the `console` in different formats, a `JSON` file,
`XML`, etc.

Please see [the current list of supported `formatter`s](./formatters/)
to know more.
