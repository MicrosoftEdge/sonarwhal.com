# How to evaluate JavaScript

Sometimes a rule needs to evaluate some JavaScript in the context of
the page. To do that you need to use `context.evaluate`. This method
will always return a `Promise` even if your code does not return one.

One important thing is that your code needs to be wrapped in an
Immediate Invoked Function Expression to work.

The following scripts will work:

<!-- eslint-disable -->

```js
const script =
`(function() {
    return true;
}())`;

context.evaluate(script);
```

```js
const script =
`(function() {
    return Promise.resolve(true);
}())`;

context.evaluate(script);
```

The following does not:

```js
const script = `return true;`;

context.evaluate(script);
```

```js
const script = `return Promise.resolve(true);`;

context.evaluate(script);
```
