# Contributing

## Commit messages

Commit messages should have the following structure:

```text
Capitalized, short (50 characters or less) summary
<blank line>
If necessary, more detailed explanatory text, strapped to about 72
characters or so.

The commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like `git merge` and `git revert`.

If applicable, at the end, write where the users can find more
information (URL(s) or other related issues), and/or what this commit
fixes.
